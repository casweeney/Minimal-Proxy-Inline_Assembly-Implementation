# Minimal Proxy Inline Assembly Implementation

This project demonstrates the use of Minimal Proxy to clone a Store smart contract using inline assembly in solidity.

### Importance of Minimal Proxy: EIP-1167
1. Clone already deployed smart contracts using the contract address
2. Gas efficient way to clone smart contracts
3. It only stores a small bytecode of the cloned contract and not the entire bytecode of the main contract that was cloned.
